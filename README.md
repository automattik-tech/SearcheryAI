# SemanticExplorer
A semantic search engine made using python as the frontend and html as the backend. The search module is pytorch.  This engine allows you to upload your own files and to search through them. Not only can you search through them, you can ask questions about these files. Some questions may not work but most do. Some code has been generated by ChatGPT. Only use in development. This is a hobby project meant to be used for fun, please do not use in a professional setting.
